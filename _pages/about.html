<h1>  More about me! </h1>

<body>

  <p>
Aside from learning about the economy and big data, I have passions for exercise, sports, music, and enjoying time with friends. I am Midwest born and raised so it is only natural that I favor a good beer during my pastimes.

  <p>
I also love travel as it has let me see new places and gain new perspectives on life.
