  hello world
  </head>
<body>

  Iâ€™m a senior Economics major, with minors is Business and Global Markets and Society, at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I have a passion for leaning about how different industries interact with the social-economic climate of today. I am currently working on a few projects utilizing a variety of machine learning models to take a deeper look at how our broad economy runs and how we may be able to create assertions on our future.

  Aside from learning about the economy and big data, I have passions for exercise, sports, music, and enjoying time with friends. I am Midwest born and raised so it is only natural that I favor a good beer during my pastimes.
